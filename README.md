Background of this psuedo-project:

You have been hired by a non-profit organization that wishes to develop predictive models to improve the cost-effectiveness of their direct marketing campaigns to prior donors. According to their recent records, the typical overall response rate is approximately 10%. Out of those who respond and donate to the mailing, the average donation is 14.50.Eachmailingcosts
2.00 to produce and send; the mailing includes a gift of personalized address labels. It is not cost-effective to mail everyone because the expected profit from each mailing is 14.50 x 10% â€“ 2 = -$0.55.

Your client would like to develop a classification model using data from the most recent campaign that can effectively capture likely donors so that the expected net profit is maximized (i.e., ideally maximize the number of donors who receive a flyer and minimize the recipients who are non-donors). Note that weighted sampling has been used, over-representing the responders so that the sample have approximately 50% of either of donors or non-donors.

Your client would also like predict expected gift amounts from donors. 

The datasets are available on the bottom of this page. The score data are also available for the deployment of the developed model.
